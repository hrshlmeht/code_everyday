#these are the patterns which I need to master overtime to solve leetcode like problems in minutes

#1 -> prefix sum pattern 
#2 -> two pointer approach
#3 -> slidding window pattern
#4 -> fast and slow pointers
#5 -> Linkedlist in place reversals
#6 -> Monotonic stack
#7 -> top k elements pattern
#8 -> Overlapping intervals pattern
#9 -> Modified Binary search pattern 
#10 -> Binary tree traversals
#11 -> DFS Depth First Search 
#12 -> BFS Breadth first search
#13 -> Matrix Traversal
#14 -> Backtracking 
#15 -> Dynamic Programming -> (solving the optimization solutions and then breaking them into smnaller problems , storing their solutions to avoid the repititive work)
